# Plant Disease Severity Detection using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid model for the detection and severity level classification of diseases in plants. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images to accurately classify and assess the severity of diseases.

## Features
- CNN-LSTM architecture for improved sequential feature learning in plant images.
- Dataset preprocessing scripts for efficient training and evaluation.
- Model training and evaluation scripts with configurable hyperparameters.
- Web-based interface for visualizing the model predictions on new plant images.
- Trained model weights for quick deployment.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for the web-based interface)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-severity.git
   cd plant-disease-severity
