# CNN-LSTM-Hybrid-
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid model for the detection and severity level classification of diseases in plants. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images to accurately classify and assess the severity of diseases.
